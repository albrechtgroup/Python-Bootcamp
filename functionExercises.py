# Function Exercises:

""" Write a function called 'product' that accepts two
    parameters and returns the product of the two 
    parameters(multiply them together) """
from math import prod

def product(a, b):
    return a*b
print(product(2, 2))

""" Write a function called 'return_day'. This function
    takes in one parameter(a num from 1-7) and returns
    the day of the week(1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, etc.) 
    If the number is less than 1 or greater than 7, 
    the function should return 'None' """
# Hint: Store the days of the week in a list


""" Write a function called 'last_element'. This 
    function takes in one parameter(a list) and returns
    last value in the list. It should return None if
    empty. """


""" Write a function called 'number_compare'. This 
    function takes in two parameters(both numbers). 
    If the first is greater than the second, this
    function returns "First is greater". If the 2nd
    number is greater than first, the function returns
    "Second is greater" Otherwis the function returns
    "Numbers are equal" """


""" Write a function called 'single_letter_count". 
    This func takes in two parameters(2 strings)
    The first param should be a word and the 2nd
    a letter. The func returns the num of times
    that letter appears in the word. The function 
    should be case-sensitive(input doesnt matter)
    If the letter is not found in the word, the 
    function returns zero """
# Hint: take advantage of count() method.


""" Write a function called 'multiple_letter_count'
    This function takes in one parameter(a string)
    and returns a dictionary with the keys being
    the letters and values being the count of letter
    """
# Hint: Use a dictionary comprehension and count()


""" Write a function called 'list_manipulation'. This
    function should taek in four parameters(a list,
    command, location and value) """



""" Write a function called 'is_palindrome. A Palindrome
    is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of
    characters which reads teh same backward or
    forward. This function should take in one parameter
    and returns True or False depending on whether
    it is a Palindrome. """


""" Writer a function called 'frequency'. This function
    accepts a list and a search_term(this will always
    be a primitive value) and returns the number of
    times the search_term appears in the list. """


""" Write a function called 'multiply_even_numbers'. This
    function accepts a list of numbers and returns
    the product of all even numbers in the list. """


""" Write a function called 'capitalize'.This function
    accepts a string and returns the same string with
    the first letter capitalized. You may want to use
    slices to help you out. """


""" Write a function called 'compact'. This function 
    accepts a list and  returns a list of values that
    are 'truthy' values, wihtout any of the falsey
    values. """


""" Write a function called 'intersection'. This 
    function should accept two lists and return a
    list with the values that are in both input 
    lists. """


""" Write a function called 'partition'. This func
    accepts a list and a callback funct(which you 
    can assume returns True or False). The function 
    should iterater over each element in the list and
    invoke the callback func at each iteration. """
